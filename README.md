# Cryptography
Built a C# desktop app with a GUI to encrypt and decrypt text and files using multiple algorithms (Caesar, Vigen√®re, Transposition, Vernam, custom Color Code, and Product Cipher). Supported files of any type with key management and ensured files retain their original format after encryption/decryption.
